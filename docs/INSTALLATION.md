# Asterisk AI Voice Agent - Installation and Upgrade Guide (v7.4)

This guide covers fresh installations and the supported upgrade path to v7.4.0.
For release-specific behavior changes, also read the [v7.4 migration notes](MIGRATION.md#v73x-to-v740).

## Three Setup Paths

Choose the path that best fits your experience level:

## Upgrade to v7.4.0 (Existing Checkout)

This section is for operators upgrading an existing repo checkout (not a fresh install).

> ### ⚠️ Upgrading from 6.x? v7.0.0 introduced breaking changes — read first
> (v7.4 includes them; if you are already on 7.x this is an in-place upgrade.)
> Before upgrading from 6.x, review the **Upgrade Notes** at the top of the
> [v7.0.0 CHANGELOG entry](../CHANGELOG.md) and the
> [Agents migration guide](OPERATOR_MIGRATION.md). In short:
> - **Default `admin`/`admin` login is removed.** If your install was **still using `admin`/`admin`**,
>   it is automatically rotated on first start to a one-time random password printed to the `admin_ui`
>   logs (`docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs admin_ui | grep -i password`), which you must
>   change at first login. **If you already changed the admin password, nothing changes — your existing
>   login keeps working** and no new password is printed.
> - **`/api/config/export` no longer bundles `.env`** by default (pass `include_secrets=true`).
> - **Your contexts migrate into `agents.db`** on first v7.4 AI Engine start. Contexts are
>   removed from runtime and navigation; manage personas in **Agents**. Existing dialplans
>   keep working through the deprecated `AI_CONTEXT` compatibility selector, but new
>   dialplans must use `AI_AGENT`. Do not delete `agents.db` as a rollback method; see the
>   [operator migration rollback boundaries](OPERATOR_MIGRATION.md#rollback-boundaries).

### 0) Record local changes and take a backup

Run these commands from your actual checkout path. Do not assume it is `/root/...`:

```bash
cd /path/to/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk
git status --short
git diff --binary > ../aava-pre-v740-working-tree.patch
git diff --binary --cached > ../aava-pre-v740-staged.patch
```

Back up at least:

- `.env`, `config/ai-agent.yaml`, `config/ai-agent.local.yaml`, and `config/users.json`;
- custom files under `config/contexts/` while upgrading from a Context-based release;
- `data/operator/agents.db` and `data/call_history.db` when present; and
- any custom secrets, certificates, recordings, or media stored outside those paths.

The v7.4 updater also creates a per-job backup under `.agent/update-backups/` and
uses SQLite's online backup API for `agents.db` and `call_history.db`. An independent
off-host backup is still recommended.

### 1) Choose how to handle tracked source changes

v7.4 never silently decides what to do with edits to tracked project files:

| Choice | Use it when | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `retain` | You intentionally modified project source and want to reapply it | Changes are stashed and reapplied; a conflict stops safely and leaves the stash for recovery |
| `overwrite` | The changes are accidental, generated, or already preserved elsewhere | Tracked source edits are discarded after the updater backup; operator configuration and databases are restored |
| `abort` | You want to inspect or commit changes first | No update is applied |

Untracked files are not overwritten by default. Review `git status --short` before
choosing. If in doubt, choose `abort` and preserve the changes outside the checkout.

### 2) Update using the v7.4 updater

Preferred CLI path:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune --tags
agent update --ref v7.4.0 --include-ui --local-changes=retain
```

Replace `retain` with your explicit `overwrite` or `abort` decision. In an interactive
terminal, the default `ask` policy presents the same choices. Non-interactive runs must
specify a policy.

The Admin UI path is **System → Updates**. Preview the plan, select **Retain local
changes**, **Overwrite local changes**, or **Abort**, then proceed. Use a published tag
for production; untagged branches belong on development systems only.

#### Update planner recovery, including issue [#518](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/issues/518)

Older installations, and checkouts with ownership left over from an older root-run
update, can show `Failed to compute update plan`. Fixed Admin UI releases print the
updater's exact stderr followed by host-CLI recovery commands. The common causes are a
stale cached updater image, mixed checkout/`.git` ownership, a checkout mounted below
`/root` that the updater's non-root user cannot traverse, or tracked local edits that the
old UI did not surface.

Bootstrap the *target release CLI* first so recovery does not depend on the failing UI
planner container:

```bash
(
  set -o pipefail
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/main/scripts/install-cli.sh \
    | sudo env AGENT_VERSION=v7.4.0 INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin bash
) || { echo "Failed to install requested agent CLI; update not attempted" >&2; exit 2; }

sudo /usr/local/bin/agent version || {
  echo "Installed agent CLI is not runnable; update not attempted" >&2
  exit 2
}
git fetch origin --prune --tags
/usr/local/bin/agent update --ref v7.4.0 --include-ui --local-changes=retain \
  --self-update=false
```

Use `overwrite` only after the patch/backup step above confirms you do not need the
tracked edits.

For `main` or an advanced branch target, do not substitute the latest published CLI:
branch updater behavior can be newer than the latest release. The recovery commands
shown by the fixed Admin UI resolve the deployment checkout's actual `origin`, clone the
exact selected ref into a temporary directory, build its CLI with the project's Go 1.22
container, install that binary at `/usr/local/bin/agent`, and fail closed if origin
resolution, fetch, build, installation, or cleanup fails. This supports branches hosted
on the operator's fork or private origin instead of assuming the public upstream. If
Docker or Git cannot perform that exact-ref bootstrap, select a published release tag
or repair the host prerequisites; do not continue with an older CLI.

If the exact UI error contains either of these messages:

```text
mkdir: cannot create directory '/root': Permission denied
error: cannot open '.git/FETCH_HEAD': Permission denied
```

run the recovery from an SSH shell on the host. The privileged steps repair only the
bounded Git/updater metadata, then the update runs as the checkout owner. This bypasses
the short-lived updater container's `/root` traversal problem without recursively
changing checkout ownership:

```bash

```

Do not recursively `chown` the checkout: production checkouts can legitimately contain
runtime files owned by Asterisk or another service account. The recovery above repairs
only `.git` and `.agent`, which are owned by the checkout operator. The `setpriv` call
uses the checkout owner's group vector and explicitly includes the Docker socket GID,
so Docker access does not depend on which sudoer pasted the recovery. Patch capture
and CLI bootstrap fail closed before any repair or update if Git cannot inspect the
checkout or read either diff, the filesystem cannot write the preservation file, the
checkout owner cannot be determined, or the requested CLI cannot be downloaded,
installed, and executed. Metadata repair also stops recovery immediately if either
bounded ownership change fails. Patch capture includes binary payloads, and the guarded
update disables CLI self-update so it keeps the requested recovery version. Repository
ancestors that the checkout owner cannot traverse receive execute-only access inside a
guarded subshell; the owner-level command enters `AAVA_REPO` only after that repair, and
the exact original modes are restored on success, failure, or interruption. The early
inspection and patch commands use privileged absolute paths, so
they do not require the sudoer to traverse `/root` before the guard is active. If Git
metadata resolves outside the checkout's real `.git` directory (including a linked
worktree or gitfile), recovery prints the resolved paths and stops before `chown`;
inspect and repair that shared metadata manually rather than changing another
repository recursively. If Git instead reports *dubious ownership*, add only this
checkout as safe using the path
printed by Git; `safe.directory` does not fix a real write-permission failure:

```bash
git config --global --add safe.directory "$(pwd)"

# Use the same identity that will run the recovery command. If that is root:
sudo git config --global --add safe.directory "$(pwd)"
```

#### If the host `agent` CLI recovery also fails

First confirm that the command being executed is the newly bootstrapped CLI, not an
older binary earlier in `PATH`:

```bash
command -v agent || true
/usr/local/bin/agent version
```

Use the exact failure to choose the next safe action:

| CLI output | Recovery |
|---|---|
| `unknown flag: --local-changes` | The old CLI is still running. Repeat the target-release install command above and invoke `/usr/local/bin/agent` by absolute path. |
| `detected dubious ownership` | Add only the current checkout to `safe.directory` for the same user that runs `agent`; this is a trust check, not a permissions repair. |
| `.git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied` or another `.git` write failure | Preserve the patch, then rerun the guarded checkout-owner recovery block above. Do not run the CLI directly as root or recursively change ownership. |
| `working tree has local changes` or `local-change policy` | Re-run with an explicit `--local-changes=retain`, `overwrite`, or `abort`; use `retain` unless the tracked edits are already preserved and intentionally disposable. |
| merge, index, or stash conflict | Follow the conflict procedure below before retrying. Do not delete the stash or use `git reset --hard`. |
| Docker image or Compose failure | Keep the updater backup and follow the service-specific recovery below; do not delete operator databases. |

To capture the full CLI error for support or an issue without losing its exit status,
set the log path and `pipefail`, then replace the final `agent update` command inside the
guarded subshell above with this equivalent pipeline:

```bash
AAVA_RECOVERY_LOG="$(dirname "$AAVA_REPO")/aava-update-recovery.log"
set -o pipefail
sudo "$AAVA_SETPRIV" --reuid="$AAVA_UID" --regid="$AAVA_GID" \
  --groups="$AAVA_GROUPS" /bin/sh -c 'cd "$1" && shift && exec "$@"' \
  sh "$AAVA_REPO" /usr/local/bin/agent update --ref v7.4.0 --include-ui \
  --local-changes=retain --self-update=false 2>&1 | sudo tee "$AAVA_RECOVERY_LOG"
```

The CLI creates its backup before changing the checkout. If the command reports a
backup path or a preserved stash, include those paths in the support report but do not
upload `.env`, database files, credentials, or other secrets.

#### If an earlier update left a merge or stash conflict

Do not delete the repository, `agents.db`, or the stash. First capture the state:

```bash
git status
git stash list
git diff > ../aava-update-conflict.patch
```

Resolve and commit the conflict if the changes are wanted. If you intentionally choose
to abandon the interrupted merge, `git merge --abort` is the first recovery action.
When Git says no merge is active but the index is still conflicted, preserve the patch
and stash before using `git reset --merge HEAD`. Then rerun the v7.4 updater with an
explicit policy. Never use `git reset --hard` as generic upgrade advice.

#### If the update fails with “No such image: ...local-ai-server:latest”

Some installations never started or built the optional `local_ai_server` container (for example, if you only use remote providers).
Older `agent update` versions could still try to recreate `local_ai_server` when Compose files change.

To recover without enabling `local_ai_server`, bring up only the services you actually run:

```bash
cd /path/to/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk

# If the update planned to rebuild admin_ui, recreate it (safe even if not needed):
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate admin_ui

docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --remove-orphans --no-build ai_engine admin_ui
agent check
```

If you *do* want `local_ai_server`, build it and then re-run compose:

```bash
cd /path/to/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent build local_ai_server
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --remove-orphans --no-build
```

### 3) Re-run preflight

```bash
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes
```

Preflight ensures required host directories exist with correct permissions, including:
- `./data` (Call History SQLite and runtime state)
- `./models/{stt,tts,llm,kroko}` (mounted into `ai_engine` and `local_ai_server` as `/app/models`)
- `./asterisk_media/ai-generated` (mounted as `/mnt/asterisk_media/ai-generated` for generated audio)

Preflight also audits Asterisk configuration (when Asterisk is on the same host):
- Checks ARI enabled, ARI user, HTTP server, dialplan context, and required modules
- Writes results to `data/asterisk_status.json` — the Admin UI **System → Asterisk** page reads this manifest to display a configuration checklist with guided fix commands

> **Standalone GPU server?** If this machine only runs `local_ai_server` (no Asterisk, no Admin UI), use the `--local-server` flag to skip Asterisk/media checks:
> ```bash
> sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes --local-server
> ```
> This only runs GPU detection, `.env` seeding, and port 8765 availability checks. See [LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md — Topology 3](LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md#topology-3-split-server-remote-gpu) for the full split-server guide.

> Note: Admin UI health checks validate the media directory from within the `admin_ui` container.
> On some systems Asterisk uses a non-default group ID; newer releases auto-detect this at `admin_ui` startup so the UI doesn't incorrectly warn after reboot.

#### Media directory persistence across reboots (important)

Generated audio is written to the host under:

- `./asterisk_media/ai-generated` (host)
- mounted into containers as `/mnt/asterisk_media/ai-generated`

For **Asterisk file playback** (e.g., `sound:ai-generated/...`) the host Asterisk must be able to read those files under:

- `/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated`

Preflight (and `install.sh`) uses the following strategy:

1. **Prefer a symlink**: `/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated` → `./asterisk_media/ai-generated` (works when the `asterisk` user can traverse the repo path).
2. **Fallback to a bind mount** when the repo path is not accessible (common if the project is under `/root` with `0700` permissions):
   - `/var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated` is bind-mounted to `./asterisk_media/ai-generated`
   - The bind mount is **persisted in `/etc/fstab`** (systemd-friendly, best-effort) so it survives host reboots.

Quick verification on the host:

```bash
ls -la /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated
mountpoint /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ai-generated || true
```

If you use **external/shared storage** for media (common on FreePBX), you may have `./asterisk_media` as a symlink to something like `/mnt/asterisk_media`. In that case, you must also ensure the **external mount itself** is persisted across reboots (e.g., via `/etc/fstab` or a systemd mount unit). If the mount doesn’t come up after a reboot, the Admin UI will report a Host Directory error and you should:

```bash
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes
```

Tip: `--persist-media-mount` is available as a troubleshooting/verification helper when bind-mount mode is used:

```bash
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes --persist-media-mount
```

If preflight reports warnings or failures, resolve them first, then re-run preflight until it returns clean:
- Troubleshooting: `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`
- Re-run: `sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes`
- Verify: `agent check`

### 4) Rebuild and recreate containers

The updater normally performs this step. If you are recovering manually:

```bash
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate admin_ui ai_engine
```

If your configuration requires local inference:

```bash
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate local_ai_server
```

### 5) Verify the upgrade

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:15000/health
agent check

# If using local AI server (GPU or CPU), also verify STT/LLM/TTS:
agent check --local
# Or for a remote GPU server:
# agent check --remote <gpu-ip>
```

Then verify in the Admin UI:

1. **Agents** contains all expected migrated agents and exactly one default.
2. Each Agent's transfer, Google Calendar, Microsoft Calendar, and voicemail access is correct.
3. **Tools → Save & Apply** increments the tool generation without restarting AI Engine.
4. A test call reaches the expected Agent, can use an allowed tool, and appears in Call History.
5. `docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs --since=10m ai_engine admin_ui` has no repeated errors.

### Appendix: Legacy upgrade notes (4.x → 4.6)

- `.env`:
  - Review ARI settings: `ASTERISK_ARI_PORT`, `ASTERISK_ARI_SCHEME`, `ASTERISK_ARI_SSL_VERIFY`
  - If using rootless Docker/Podman, set a persistent `DOCKER_SOCK=...` in `.env` (not only `export ...`)
  - Reference: `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
- Admin UI “save vs apply”:
  - `.env` edits from the UI may normalize quoting and remove duplicate keys; this is expected in 4.6+
- OpenAI Realtime:
  - Baseline includes a small audio output tweak; validate your call quality if you customized encoding/sample-rate

> ⚠️ **Operator note (production hardening):** `ai_engine` exposes a health/metrics server on port `15000`.
> In the default compose, it binds to `0.0.0.0` so `admin_ui` can reach it reliably on best-effort hosts.
> For production, restrict access via firewall/VPN/reverse proxy, or bind it to localhost by setting:
> - `HEALTH_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1` in `.env` (then `docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --force-recreate ai_engine`)
> - Optional: set `HEALTH_API_TOKEN` in `.env` if you need authenticated remote access.

### Path A: Admin UI Setup Wizard (Recommended)

**5-minute visual setup** with the new web-based Admin UI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk.git
cd AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk

# Run preflight (REQUIRED - creates .env, generates JWT_SECRET)
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes

# Start Admin UI first
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate admin_ui

# Complete the Setup Wizard in Admin UI, then start ai_engine
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build ai_engine
```

If you hit permission/container/health issues during setup, start with:
- `agent check`
- `sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes`
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md`

**Access the Admin UI:**
- **Local:** `http://localhost:3003`
- **Remote server:** `http://<server-ip>:3003`

> ⚠️ **Security:** The Admin UI is accessible on the network by default.  
> **Change the admin password on first login** and restrict port 3003 (firewall/VPN/reverse proxy) for production.

#### Securing the Admin UI

The Admin UI is a privileged control plane — it has root-equivalent access to the host via the Docker socket. See [SECURITY.md "2.1 Admin UI Security"](../SECURITY.md#21-admin-ui-security) for the full threat model, Docker socket hardening options, and an nginx mTLS example.

**Caddy reverse proxy (TLS + basic auth)** — a quick production-grade option.

First make sure the Admin UI is reachable **only** through the proxy — otherwise the
default `0.0.0.0` bind leaves port 3003 directly exposed, bypassing Caddy's TLS/auth.
Set `UVICORN_HOST=127.0.0.1` in `.env` (so it binds localhost, matching the
`reverse_proxy localhost:3003` below), or firewall port 3003 from everything except the
proxy. Then:

```text
# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
admin.example.com {
    basicauth {
        # Generate hash: caddy hash-password --plaintext 'your-password'
        operator $2a$14$...bcrypt-hash-here...
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:3003
}
```

```bash
# Install Caddy, then:
sudo caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

**VPN alternative** — put the host on a WireGuard tunnel (`wg-quick up wg0`) and reach the
UI only over it. A plain `localhost` bind is *not* reachable from a remote WireGuard peer,
so do one of: bind the Admin UI to the host's WireGuard interface IP
(`UVICORN_HOST=<wg-interface-ip>`), run a local reverse proxy listening on that interface,
or SSH-forward port 3003 over the tunnel. Keep 3003 firewalled on all other interfaces.

The Setup Wizard will:
1. ✅ Guide you through provider selection (OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, ElevenLabs, Local)
2. ✅ Validate your API keys with live testing
3. ✅ Test Asterisk ARI connection
4. ✅ Configure contexts and greeting
5. ✅ Start containers automatically

**First login:** retrieve the one-time password from
`docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs admin_ui | grep -i password`, then change it.

**Best for:** First-time users, production deployments, visual configuration

See [Admin UI Setup Guide](../admin_ui/UI_Setup_Guide.md) for detailed instructions.

---

### Path B: CLI Quickstart (Alternative)

**Command-line wizard** for terminal-based setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk.git
cd AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk

./install.sh
agent setup
```

**Best for:** Headless servers, scripted deployments, CLI preference

> Note: `agent quickstart` and `agent init` are still available for backward compatibility, but `agent setup` is the recommended CLI wizard for v6.5.4.

---

### Path C: Manual Setup (Advanced Users)

**Traditional installer** with manual configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk.git
cd AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. Guide you through **3 baseline choices** (a fast-path subset):
   - **OpenAI Realtime** - Fastest (0.5-1.5s), requires OPENAI_API_KEY
   - **Deepgram Voice Agent** - Enterprise (1-2s), requires DEEPGRAM_API_KEY + OPENAI_API_KEY
   - **Local Hybrid** - Privacy-focused (3-7s), requires OPENAI_API_KEY + 8GB RAM
2. Validate ARI connection with your Asterisk server
3. Prompt for required API keys
4. Offer CLI tool installation
5. Start Docker containers automatically

**Best for:** Advanced users, custom configurations, specific requirements

If you want to use additional providers (e.g., Google Live, ElevenLabs) or switch between multiple golden configs, use the Admin UI Setup Wizard (Path A) or edit `config/ai-agent.yaml` directly.

Notes:
- The project ships **5 golden baseline configs** under `config/ai-agent.golden-*.yaml`.
- A **Fully Local** mode is also supported (100% on-premises), but requires stronger hardware for local LLM inference; see `docs/LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md` and `docs/HARDWARE_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

**Local note:** This project does **not** bundle models in images. For recommended local build/run profiles (including a smaller `local-core` build), see `docs/LOCAL_PROFILES.md`.

**Kroko note:** `INCLUDE_KROKO_EMBEDDED` is off by default to keep the `local_ai_server` image lighter. Enable it only if you need embedded Kroko (see `docs/LOCAL_PROFILES.md`).

**Container OS note:** `admin_ui` and `ai_engine` ship on Debian `bookworm` (Python `3.11`). `local_ai_server` ships on Debian `trixie` intentionally (for embedded Kroko glibc compatibility).

## Detailed Installation

For manual installation, custom configurations, or troubleshooting, continue below.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: A modern Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 7+).
- **Asterisk**: Version 18 or newer. FreePBX 15+ is also supported.
- **ARI (Asterisk REST Interface)**: Enabled and configured on your Asterisk server.
- **Docker**: Latest stable version of Docker and Docker Compose. Podman is community-supported (aliased as `docker`) but not officially tested.
- **Git**: Required to clone the project repository.
- **Network Access**: Your server must be able to make outbound connections to the internet for Docker image downloads and API access to AI providers.

### Prerequisite checks

- Verify required Asterisk modules are loaded:

  ```bash
  asterisk -rx "module show like res_ari_applications"
  asterisk -rx "module show like app_audiosocket"
  ```

  Expected example output:

  ```
  Module                         Description                               Use Count  Status   Support Level
  res_ari_applications.so        RESTful API module - Stasis application   0          Running  core
  1 modules loaded

  Module                         Description                               Use Count  Status   Support Level
  app_audiosocket.so             AudioSocket Application                    20         Running  extended
  1 modules loaded
  ```

  If Asterisk < 18, on FreePBX Distro run:

  ```bash
  asterisk-switch-version   # aka asterisk-version-switch
  ```

  and select Asterisk 18+.

- Quick install Docker
  - Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
    docker --version && docker compose version
    ```

- Debian (11/12):

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
    docker --version && docker compose version
    ```

- CentOS/Rocky/Alma:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
    sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    sudo dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    sudo systemctl enable --now docker
    docker --version && docker compose version
    ```

### Rootless Docker (best-effort)

If your host uses **rootless Docker**, the Admin UI needs the rootless socket mounted. Set `DOCKER_SOCK` before starting `admin_ui`:

```bash
export DOCKER_SOCK=/run/user/$(id -u)/docker.sock
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate admin_ui
```

`./preflight.sh` prints the exact command for your system when it detects rootless Docker.

## 2. Installation Steps

The installation is handled by an interactive script that will guide you through the process.

### Step 2.1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository to a directory on your server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk.git
cd AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk
```

### Step 2.2: Run the Installation Script

Execute the `install.sh` script. You will need to run it with `sudo` if your user does not have permissions to run Docker.

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script will perform the following actions:

1. **System Checks**: Verify that Docker is installed and running.
2. **Interactive Setup**: Launch a wizard to collect configuration details.

### Step 2.3: Interactive Setup Wizard

The wizard will prompt you for the following information.

#### AI Provider Selection

You will be asked to choose an AI provider.

- **[1] OpenAI Realtime**: Out-of-the-box realtime voice path (cloud).
- **[2] Deepgram Voice Agent**: Cloud STT/TTS with strong latency/quality.
- **[3] Local Hybrid**: Local STT/TTS + cloud LLM (audio stays local).

> **GPU users:** If you selected Local Hybrid (or plan to run Fully Local), and you have an NVIDIA GPU, build with the GPU compose overlay for dramatically faster inference (~10-30x). See **[LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md](LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md)** for full GPU setup including `docker-compose.gpu.yml`, nvidia-container-toolkit, and split-server topologies.

#### Provider Configuration

Based on your selection, you will need to provide API keys.

- **Deepgram API Key**: Required if you select the Deepgram provider.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required if you select any OpenAI-based pipeline.

#### Asterisk ARI Configuration

You will need to provide the connection details for your Asterisk server's ARI.

- **Asterisk Host**: The hostname or IP address of your Asterisk server.
- **ARI Username**: The username for an ARI user.
- **ARI Password**: The password for the ARI user.

### What You'll Need (at a glance)

- A Linux server with Docker + Docker Compose
- Asterisk 18+ or FreePBX 15+ with ARI enabled
- API keys for your chosen provider (optional): `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`

### Step 2.4: Configuration File Generation

After you complete the wizard, the script will create a `.env` file in the project root with all your settings. You can manually edit this file later if you need to make changes.

### Step 2.5: Start the Service

Once the configuration is complete, the script will prompt you to build and start the Docker container. You can also do this manually.

```bash
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up --build -d
```

> IMPORTANT: First startup time (local models)
>
> If you selected a Local or Hybrid workflow, the `local_ai_server` may take 15–20 minutes on first startup to load LLM/TTS models depending on your CPU, RAM, and disk speed. This is expected and readiness may show degraded until models have fully loaded. Monitor with:
>
> ```bash
> docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs -f local_ai_server
> ```
>
> Subsequent restarts are typically much faster due to OS page cache. If startup is too slow for your hardware, consider using MEDIUM or LIGHT tier models and update the `.env` model paths accordingly.
>
> **GPU acceleration:** Use `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d --build local_ai_server` for CUDA-accelerated LLM inference. Set `LOCAL_LLM_GPU_LAYERS=-1` in `.env`. See [LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md](LOCAL_ONLY_SETUP.md) for the full guide.
>
> **Runtime mode:** `local_ai_server` auto-selects runtime based on GPU availability:
> - `GPU_AVAILABLE=true` → `full` mode (STT + LLM + TTS preloaded)
> - `GPU_AVAILABLE=false` → `minimal` mode (STT + TTS only; LLM loaded on demand)
> Override with `LOCAL_AI_MODE=full` or `LOCAL_AI_MODE=minimal` in `.env`.

## 3. Verifying the Installation

After starting the service, you can check that it is running correctly.

### Check Docker Container Status

```bash
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent ps
```

You should see the `ai_engine` container running, and `local_ai_server` if your selected configuration requires local STT/LLM/TTS.

## First Successful Call (Canonical Checklist)

This section is designed to remove ambiguity between “containers started” and a **working phone call**.

### 1) Confirm engine health

```bash
curl http://localhost:15000/health
```

Expected: `{"status":"healthy"}`

### 2) Confirm ARI connectivity

In `ai_engine` logs, look for indicators that ARI is reachable and authenticated.

```bash
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs -f ai_engine
```

If ARI is not reachable, verify `.env` values and that Asterisk ARI is enabled:
- `ASTERISK_HOST`
- `ASTERISK_ARI_USERNAME`
- `ASTERISK_ARI_PASSWORD`

### 3) Choose transport using the validated compatibility matrix

Transport selection depends on your chosen provider mode and playback method.

Use the validated combinations in:
- **[Transport & Playback Mode Compatibility Guide](Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md)**

### 4) Configure Asterisk dialplan and reload

Add the minimal Stasis dialplan in **[5. Configure Asterisk Dialplan](#5-configure-asterisk-dialplan)** below, then reload your dialplan:

```bash
asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"
```

### 5) Place a test call and verify expected outcomes

Expected outcomes:
- You hear a greeting.
- The call appears in **Admin UI → Call History** (if enabled in your config/release).
- `ai_engine` logs show the call entering Stasis and starting the configured transport.

If you get “greeting only” or “no audio”, jump to:
- **[Transport Compatibility](Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md)**
- **[Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md)**

### Check Container Logs

```bash
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs -f ai_engine
```

Look for a message indicating a successful connection to Asterisk ARI and that the engine is ready to start the selected transport.

For transport-specific expectations (AudioSocket vs ExternalMedia RTP), see:
- **[Transport & Playback Mode Compatibility Guide](Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md)**

### 5. Configure Asterisk Dialplan

The engine uses **ARI-based architecture** - the dialplan just hands calls to Stasis. The engine manages audio transport internally.

**Minimal Dialplan** (works for all supported modes):

Add to `/etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf`:

```asterisk
[from-ai-agent]
exten => s,1,NoOp(Asterisk AI Voice Agent)
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

**Optional: Provider Override via Channel Variables**:

```asterisk
[from-ai-agent-support]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AI Agent - Customer Support)
 same => n,Set(AI_PROVIDER=deepgram)
 same => n,Set(AI_AGENT=support)
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
 same => n,Hangup()

[from-ai-agent-openai]
exten => s,1,NoOp(AI Agent - OpenAI Realtime)
 same => n,Set(AI_PROVIDER=openai_realtime)
 same => n,Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)
 same => n,Hangup()
```

**Important:** Do NOT use `AudioSocket()` in the dialplan. The engine originates AudioSocket channels via ARI automatically.

**How It Works:**
1. Call enters `Stasis(asterisk-ai-voice-agent)`
2. Engine receives StasisStart event via ARI
3. Engine starts the configured transport and playback mode for that call
4. Engine bridges the transport channel with the caller
5. Two-way audio flows automatically

For validated transport/playback combinations, see:
- **[Transport & Playback Mode Compatibility Guide](Transport-Mode-Compatibility.md)**

After adding the dialplan, reload Asterisk configuration:

```bash
asterisk -rx "dialplan reload"
```

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to ARI**:
  - Verify that your Asterisk `host`, `username`, and `password` are correct in the `.env` file.
  - Ensure that the ARI port (usually 8088) is accessible from the Docker container.
  - Check your `ari.conf` and `http.conf` in Asterisk.
- **AI does not respond**:
  - Check that your API keys in the `.env` file are correct.
- **Audio Quality Issues**:
  - Confirm AudioSocket is connected (see Asterisk CLI and `ai_engine` logs).
  - Use a tmpfs/SSD for the media volume (default: `./asterisk_media` on host, mounted as `/mnt/asterisk_media` in `ai_engine`) to minimize I/O latency for file-based playback.
  - Verify you are not appending file extensions to ARI `sound:` URIs (Asterisk will add them automatically).

- **No host Python 3 installed (scripts/Makefile)**:
  - The Makefile auto-falls back to running helper scripts inside the `ai_engine` container. You'll see a hint when it does.
  - Check your environment:

        ```bash
        make check-python
        ```

  - Run helpers directly in the container if desired:

        ```bash
        docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent exec -T ai_engine python /app/scripts/validate_externalmedia_config.py
        docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent exec -T ai_engine python /app/scripts/test_externalmedia_call.py
        docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent exec -T ai_engine python /app/scripts/monitor_externalmedia.py
        docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent exec -T ai_engine python /app/scripts/capture_test_logs.py --duration 40
        docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent exec -T ai_engine python /app/scripts/analyze_logs.py /app/logs/latest.json
        ```

- **Container crashes with NumPy X86_V2 CPU error**:

  If containers fail to start with an error like:

  ```text
  RuntimeError: NumPy was built with baseline optimizations:
  (X86_V2) but your machine doesn't support:
  (X86_V2).
  ```

  This means your CPU lacks SSE4.1/SSE4.2 instructions required by NumPy 2.x. This commonly occurs on:
  - Older KVM/QEMU virtual machines with "Common KVM processor"
  - Pre-2013 physical CPUs
  - Some cloud VPS instances with legacy CPU emulation

  **Fix**: Pin NumPy to version 1.x (compatible with older CPUs):

  ```bash
  cd /path/to/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk

  # Fix ai_engine requirements
  sed -i 's/numpy>=1.24.0/numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0/g' requirements.txt

  # Fix admin_ui requirements
  sed -i 's/numpy>=1.24.0/numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0/g' admin_ui/backend/requirements.txt

  # Rebuild containers with --no-cache to force fresh install
  docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent build --no-cache ai_engine admin_ui

  # Recreate containers
  docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --force-recreate ai_engine admin_ui
  ```

  **Verify your CPU supports X86_V2** (optional diagnostic):

  ```bash
  grep -E 'sse4_1|sse4_2' /proc/cpuinfo
  ```

  If no output, your CPU lacks the required instructions and the fix above is needed.

For more advanced troubleshooting, refer to the project's main `README.md` or open an issue in the repository.
